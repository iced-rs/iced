## Aspect ratio
A column of:
- A `Responsive` with a 1:1 green square and some buttons underneath that respect the square width.
- A `Responsive` with a 16:9 blue container.

The darker colors show the total space of the responsive.

The __[`main`]__ file contains all the code of the example.

You can run it with `cargo run`:
```
cargo run --package aspect_ratio
```

[`main`]: src/main.rs
