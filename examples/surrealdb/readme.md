## Demo UI using SurrealDB

This UI was put together to show how Iced can be used as the UI for a frontend that leverages a number of nice SurrealDB features such as vector embeddings, full-text search and graph queries. The code looks for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `MISTRAL_API_KEY` to get embeddings but will still work without them.

This example was made into [a blog post](https://surrealdb.com/blog/building-an-ai-native-multi-model-ui-with-surrealdb) discussing how it was put together and how the SurrealQL queries work.
