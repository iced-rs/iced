# Keyboard Navigation
All the example code is located in the __[`main`](src/main.rs)__ file.

You can run it with `cargo run`:
```
cargo run  --package keyboard_navigation
```

Tab navigation between widgets
Space, Enter, NumEnter will activate the widget as expected
Slider will toggle grabbing when you activate. I find this to be best case with sliders and keyboard / gamepad inputs.
