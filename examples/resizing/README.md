## Resizing

A window with buttons to programatically resize the window. This may not work on
all platforms, since not all platforms allow user code to resize the window.

The __[`main`]__ file contains all the code of the example.

You can run it with `cargo run`:
```
cargo run --package resizing
```

[`main`]: src/main.rs
