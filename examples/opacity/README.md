# Opacity

An example demonstrating the opacity rendering feature.

This example shows:
- Static opacity applied to widgets
- Fade-in animation
- Fade-out animation
- Nested opacity (opacity stacking)

The opacity feature allows you to render any widget with transparency,
and properly composes with nested opacity calls.

</div>

You can run it with `cargo run`:

```bash
cargo run --package opacity
```
