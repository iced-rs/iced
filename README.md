## Features

* Simple, easy-to-use, batteries-included API
* Type-safe, reactive programming model
* [Cross-platform support] (Windows, macOS, Linux, and [the Web])
* Responsive layout
* Built-in widgets (including [text inputs], [scrollables], and more!)
* Custom widget support (create your own!)
* [Debug overlay with performance metrics]
* First-class support for async actions (use futures!)
* [Modular ecosystem] split into reusable parts:
  * A [renderer-agnostic native runtime] enabling integration with existing systems
  * Two [built-in renderers] leveraging [`wgpu`] and [`tiny-skia`]
    * [`iced_wgpu`] supporting Vulkan, Metal and DX12
    * [`iced_tiny_skia`] offering a software alternative as a fallback
  * A [windowing shell]
  * A [web runtime] leveraging the DOM

__Iced is currently experimental software.__ [Take a look at the roadmap],
[check out the issues], and [feel free to contribute!]

## Installation

Add `iced` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
iced = "0.9"
```

If your project is using a Rust edition older than 2021, then you will need to
set `resolver = "2"` in the `[package]` section as well.

__Iced moves fast and the `master` branch can contain breaking changes!__ If
you want to learn about a specific release, check out [the release list].

[the release list]: https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/releases

## Overview

Inspired by [The Elm Architecture], Iced expects you to split user interfaces
into four different concepts:

* __State__ — the state of your application
* __Messages__ — user interactions or meaningful events that you care
  about
* __View logic__ — a way to display your __state__ as widgets that
  may produce __messages__ on user interaction
* __Update logic__ — a way to react to __messages__ and update your
  __state__

We can build something to see how this works! Let's say we want a simple counter
that can be incremented and decremented using two buttons.

We start by modelling the __state__ of our application:

```rust
struct Counter {
    // The counter value
    value: i32,
}
```

Next, we need to define the possible user interactions of our counter:
the button presses. These interactions are our __messages__:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Message {
    IncrementPressed,
    DecrementPressed,
}
```

Now, let's show the actual counter by putting it all together in our
__view logic__:

```rust
use iced::widget::{button, column, text, Column};

impl Counter {
    pub fn view(&self) -> Column<Message> {
        // We use a column: a simple vertical layout
        column![
            // The increment button. We tell it to produce an
            // `IncrementPressed` message when pressed
            button("+").on_press(Message::IncrementPressed),

            // We show the value of the counter here
            text(self.value).size(50),

            // The decrement button. We tell it to produce a
            // `DecrementPressed` message when pressed
            button("-").on_press(Message::DecrementPressed),
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to be able to react to any produced __messages__ and change our
__state__ accordingly in our __update logic__:

```rust
impl Counter {
    // ...

    pub fn update(&mut self, message: Message) {
        match message {
            Message::IncrementPressed => {
                self.value += 1;
            }
            Message::DecrementPressed => {
                self.value -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And that's everything! We just wrote a whole user interface. Iced is now able
to:

  1. Take the result of our __view logic__ and layout its widgets.
  1. Process events from our system and produce __messages__ for our
     __update logic__.
  1. Draw the resulting user interface.

## Implementation details

Iced was originally born as an attempt at bringing the simplicity of [Elm] and
[The Elm Architecture] into [Coffee], a 2D game engine I am working on.

The core of the library was implemented during May 2019 in [this pull request].
[The first alpha version] was eventually released as
[a renderer-agnostic GUI library]. The library did not provide a renderer and
implemented the current [tour example] on top of [`ggez`], a game library.

Since then, the focus has shifted towards providing a batteries-included,
end-user-oriented GUI library, while keeping [the ecosystem] modular:
