/// A sandboxed [`Application`].
///
/// If you are a just getting started with the library, this trait offers a
/// simpler interface than [`Application`].
///
/// Unlike an [`Application`], a [`Sandbox`] cannot run any asynchronous
/// actions or be initialized with some external flags. However, both traits
/// are very similar and upgrading from a [`Sandbox`] is very straightforward.
///
/// Therefore, it is recommended to always start by implementing this trait and
/// upgrade only once necessary.
///
/// # Examples
/// [The repository has a bunch of examples] that use the [`Sandbox`] trait:
///
/// - [`bezier_tool`], a Paint-like tool for drawing BÃ©zier curves using the
/// [`Canvas widget`].
/// - [`counter`], the classic counter example explained in [the overview].
/// - [`custom_widget`], a demonstration of how to build a custom widget that
/// draws a circle.
/// - [`geometry`], a custom widget showcasing how to draw geometry with the
/// `Mesh2D` primitive in [`iced_wgpu`].
/// - [`pane_grid`], a grid of panes that can be split, resized, and
/// reorganized.
/// - [`progress_bar`], a simple progress bar that can be filled by using a
/// slider.
/// - [`styling`], an example showcasing custom styling with a light and dark
/// theme.
/// - [`svg`], an application that renders the [Ghostscript Tiger] by leveraging
/// the [`Svg` widget].
/// - [`tour`], a simple UI tour that can run both on native platforms and the
/// web!

///         Hello
///     }

///         Text::new("Hello, world!").into()
