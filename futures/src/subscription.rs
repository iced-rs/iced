/// A request to listen to external events.
///
/// Besides performing async actions on demand with `Task`, most
/// applications also need to listen to external events passively.
///
/// A [`Subscription`] is normally provided to some runtime, like a `Task`,
/// and it will generate events as long as the user keeps requesting it.
///
/// For instance, you can use a [`Subscription`] to listen to a `WebSocket`
/// connection, keyboard presses, mouse events, time ticks, etc.
///
/// # The Lifetime of a [`Subscription`]
/// Much like a [`Future`] or a [`Stream`], a [`Subscription`] does not produce any effects
/// on its own. For a [`Subscription`] to run, it must be returned to the iced runtimeâ€”normally
/// in the `subscription` function of an `application` or a `daemon`.
///
/// When a [`Subscription`] is provided to the runtime for the first time, the runtime will
/// start running it asynchronously. Running a [`Subscription`] consists in building its underlying
/// [`Stream`] and executing it in an async runtime.
///
/// Therefore, you can think of a [`Subscription`] as a "stream builder". It simply represents a way
/// to build a certain [`Stream`] together with some way to _identify_ it.
///
/// Identification is important because when a specific [`Subscription`] stops being returned to the
/// iced runtime, the runtime will kill its associated [`Stream`]. The runtime uses the identity of a
/// [`Subscription`] to keep track of it.
///
/// This way, iced allows you to declaratively __subscribe__ to particular streams of data temporarily
/// and whenever necessary.
