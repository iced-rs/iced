## [0.5.0] - 2022-11-10
### Added
- __[Stabilization of stateless widgets][stateless]__ (#1393)  
  The old widget API has been completely replaced by stateless widgets (introduced in #1284). Alongside the new API, there are a bunch of new helper functions and macros for easily describing view logic (like `row!` and `column!`).

- __[First-class theming][theming]__ (#1362)  
  A complete overhaul of our styling primitives, introducing a `Theme` as a first-class concept of the library.

- __[Widget operations][operations]__ (#1399)  
  An abstraction that can be used to traverse (and operate on) the widget tree of an application in order to query or update some widget state.

- __[`Lazy` widget][lazy]__ (#1400)  
  A widget that can call some view logic lazily only when some data has changed. Thanks to @nicksenger!

- __[Linear gradient support for `Canvas`][gradient]__ (#1448)  
  The `Canvas` widget can draw linear gradients now. Thanks to @bungoboingo!

- __[Touch support for `Canvas`][touch]__ (#1305)  
  The `Canvas` widget now supports touch events. Thanks to @artursapek!

- __[`Image` and `Svg` support for `iced_glow`][image]__ (#1485)  
  Our OpenGL renderer now is capable of rendering both the `Image` and `Svg` widgets. Thanks to @ids1024!

## [0.4.2] - 2022-05-03
### Fixed
- `Padding` type not exposed in `iced`.

## [0.4.1] - 2022-05-02
### Fixed
- Version number in `README`.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-05-02
### Added
- __[Stateless widgets][stateless]__ (#1284)  
  A brand new widget API that removes the need to keep track of internal widget state. No more `button::State` in your application!

- __[`Component` trait][component]__ (#1131)  
  A new trait to implement custom widgets with internal mutable state while using composition and [The Elm Architecture].

- __[`Responsive` widget][responsive]__ (#1193)  
  A widget that is aware of its dimensions and can be used to easily build responsive user interfaces.

- __[Experimental WebGL support][webgl]__ (#1096)  
  Applications can now be rendered into an HTML `canvas` when targeting Wasm by leveraging the WebGL support in [`wgpu`]. Thanks to @pacmancoder and @kaimast!

- __[Support for Raspberry Pis and older devices][raspberry]__ (#1160)  
  The compatibility of our OpenGL renderer has been improved and should run on any hardware that supports OpenGL 3.0+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+. Additionally, we started maintaining [Docker images for `aarch64` and `armv7`](https://github.com/orgs/iced-rs/packages) to easily cross-compile `iced` applications and target Raspberry Pis. Thanks to @derezzedex!

- __[Simpler `Renderer` APIs][renderer_apis]__ (#1110)  
  The surface of the `Renderer` APIs of the library has been considerably reduced. Instead of a `Renderer` trait per widget, now there are only 3 traits that are reused by all the widgets.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-11-26
### Added
- __[`Canvas` interactivity][canvas]__ (#325)  
  A trait-based approach to react to mouse and keyboard interactions in [the `Canvas` widget][#193].

- __[`iced_graphics` subcrate][opengl]__ (#354)  
  A backend-agnostic graphics subcrate that can be leveraged to build new renderers.

- __[OpenGL renderer][opengl]__ (#354)  
  An OpenGL renderer powered by [`iced_graphics`], [`glow`], and [`glutin`]. It is an alternative to the default [`wgpu`] renderer.

- __[Overlay support][pick_list]__ (#444)  
  Basic support for superpositioning interactive widgets on top of other widgets.

- __[Faster event loop][view]__ (#597)  
  The event loop now takes advantage of the data dependencies in [The Elm Architecture] and leverages the borrow checker to keep the widget tree alive between iterations, avoiding unnecessary rebuilds.

- __[Event capturing][event]__ (#614)  
  The runtime now can tell whether a widget has handled an event or not, easing [integration with existing applications].

- __[`PickList` widget][pick_list]__ (#444)  
  A drop-down selector widget built on top of the new overlay support.

- __[`QRCode` widget][qr_code]__ (#622)
