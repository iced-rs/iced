/// A component that displays information and allows interaction.

/// If you want to build your own widgets, you will need to implement this
/// trait.
///
/// # Examples
/// The repository has some [examples] showcasing how to implement a custom
/// widget:
///
/// - [`bezier_tool`], a Paint-like tool for drawing BÃ©zier curves using
///   [`lyon`].
/// - [`custom_widget`], a demonstration of how to build a custom widget that
///   draws a circle.
/// - [`geometry`], a custom widget showcasing how to draw geometry with the
///   `Mesh2D` primitive in [`iced_wgpu`].
