`iced_wgpu` is a [`wgpu`] renderer for [`iced_native`]. For now, it is the default renderer of Iced in native platforms.

[`wgpu`] supports most modern graphics backends: Vulkan, Metal, DX11, and DX12 (OpenGL and WebGL are still WIP). Additionally, it will support the incoming [WebGPU API].

Currently, `iced_wgpu` supports the following primitives:
- Text, which is rendered using [`wgpu_glyph`]. No shaping at all.
- Quads or rectangles, with rounded borders and a solid background color.
- Clip areas, useful to implement scrollables or hide overflowing content.
- Images and SVG, loaded from memory or the file system.
- Meshes of triangles, useful to draw geometry freely.

## Installation
Add `iced_wgpu` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
iced_wgpu = "0.4"
```

__Iced moves fast and the `master` branch can contain breaking changes!__ If
you want to learn about a specific release, check out [the release list].

## Current limitations

The current implementation is quite naive, it uses:

- A different pipeline/shader for each primitive
- A very simplistic layer model: every `Clip` primitive will generate new layers
- _Many_ render passes instead of preparing everything upfront
- A glyph cache that is trimmed incorrectly when there are multiple layers (a [`glyph_brush`] limitation)

Some of these issues are already being worked on! If you want to help, [get in touch!]
